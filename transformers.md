# Understanding the transformer

This blog is to walk through the transformer paper [**Attention is all you need**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)

We will walkthrough the encoder and decoder for translating from English to German.

## Encoder

Let us consider an English sentence : " The weather is good" . The following steps are followed in the encoder

- Each of the word is converted to its corresponding embedding 
- The above embedding is added with the positional embedding => As RNNs are not used , there needs to be a way to encode the positions
- 

## Decoder

## Training
